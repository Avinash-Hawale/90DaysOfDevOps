******* Linux Fundamentals day-01 ******** Linux Torwalds (Linux owner)

What is operating system --> Software to run CPU.

Different Operating systems :
1) Windows
2) MacOs
3) Linux Os


Client OS --> Designed for individual users, used on PCs, Laptop.
Main Features : (1) Graphical User Interface (GUI) focused  (2) Optimized for daily tasks  (3) Limited number of concurrent users  (4) Less powerful networking and security control.
Examples : Windows 10, MacOS, Ubuntu Desktop


Server OS  --> Designed to serve multiple clients, Runs on servers/ Data centers.
Main Features : (!) can handle thousands of users.  (2) Optimized for Performance, Stability, Uptime.    (3) Advanced security and access control.  (4) Often CLI-based (minimal GUI)
Examples : Windows server 2022, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) , Ubuntu Server.


**** Ways to install Linux in your system *****
1) Cloud Server (AWS, AZURE,GCP,UTHO etc)
2) Virtual box
3) Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL oe WSL2)
4) Dual book ( not recommended)
5) Docker 
6) Playground ( Linux playground Killercoda )
7) Use Linux as OS
8) GitBash


*** Linux :
Linux us an open- source operating system built around the Linux Kernel, It manages hardware, processes, files and users and let application run safely.

Linux Architecture (How it is build)  :  ASK principle (A - Application , S - SHell , K - Kernal )
Linux works in layers :

User ---> Applications (ls, vi, python, browsers)   ----> SHell (bash, sh)  --> Kernal ---> Hardware ( CPU, RAM, Disk, Network) 

Main components :

1) Kernal (Heart of Linux)  ---> The Kernal talks directly to hardware. It handles Process management, File systems, Securities & Permissions, Networking.|
                            ---> Kernal contain program which interact with Hardware. It uses Binary [ 0, 1 ] . ----> C language to convert Binary
2) Shell ( command Interpreter)  ---> SHell is interface between user and Kernel    [CLI --> Command Line Interface] 
3) Applications ( User Space) ---> Browsers, Editors, Database
4) File system (Everything is a file)   ---> Examples : Hardware --> /dev , Config --> /etc , User data --> /home , Logs --> /var/log



AWS ---> Elastic compute cloud ( EC2)
